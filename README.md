# To-Do List

A single-page application (SPA) for task management featuring an integrated stopwatch to track the time spent on each activity. This project was built with vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to showcase DOM manipulation, state management, and client-side data persistence.

# Features

* Add, Complete, and Delete Tasks: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) lifecycle management for tasks.
* Per-Task Stopwatch: Each task has an individual stopwatch to track focus time.
* Data Persistence: Tasks and their tracked time are saved in `localStorage`, so nothing is lost on page reload.
* Responsive Design: A clean and functional interface that adapts to different screen sizes.
* Smart Logic: The stopwatch cannot be started for tasks that have already been completed.
* Subtle Animations:** Visual feedback for the user when deleting tasks, improving the overall user experience.
